I'm using this project to learn VHDL. There's nothing Earth-shattering here and I'm positive everything in here has been done millions of times before. That being said...

This project defines some VHDL components: a seven-segment decoder, a rotary encoder, and a 4-digit led display. I'm using the following parts from SparkFun

4-digit 7-segment display - this is blue but using other colors as well

This is all being built with Xilinx WebPack and the wonderful Papilio 1
